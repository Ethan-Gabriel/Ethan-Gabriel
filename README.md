ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! My name is Ethan Gabriel and I recently graduated from Father Michael McGivney C.H.S as an International 
Baccalaureate Student with a top 6 average of 99.8%. I am beginning my post-secondary studies this fall at the University of Waterloo 
for Honours Electrical Engineering, CO-OP.

ðŸ‘€ I am currently working at Emergency Lighting Supplies (E.L.S) as an office administrator, preparing and organizing 
invoices for the company. I am also an Academic Tutor for Simply Scholars Tutoring & Mentoring Services, Helping secondary 
school students improve their skills in mathematics, chemistry, physics, and computer science. 

ðŸŒ± I am a level 9 pianist and a double degree black belt in Taekwondo. My hobbies include programming, solving difficult mathematical 
problems, exploring new technology, and watching car reviews. As a passionate communicator, logical thinker, and leader, I am determined 
to enhance my skills through every situation that comes my way. I am looking forward to meeting new people and learning new skills!

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! My name is Ethan Gabriel, nice to meet you! I recently completed my 1st co-op term at PCL as a Technology Analyst, providing hardware and software support to District offices across North America and Australia. I am in my 1B Term of Honours Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo and I am seeking a co-op placement for the Fall 2022 term. 

ðŸ‘€ I am currently working at Emergency Lighting Supplies (E.L.S) as an office administrator, preparing and organizing 
invoices for the company. I am also an Academic Tutor for Simply Scholars Tutoring & Mentoring Services, Helping secondary 
school students improve their skills in mathematics, chemistry, physics, and computer science. 

ðŸŒ± I am a level 9 pianist and a double degree black belt in Taekwondo. My hobbies include programming, solving difficult mathematical 
problems, exploring new technology, and watching car reviews. As a passionate communicator, logical thinker, and leader, I am determined 
to enhance my skills through every situation that comes my way. I am looking forward to meeting new people and learning new skills!
